    "LilyAnneDiscuss_George": "Lily-Anne Cheridan... now there's a name I haven't heard in years! Do I remember her?#$b#Course I do. Ain't nothing wrong with my memory!$a#$b#She was an odd one, always scribbling away in a notebook or what-not.#$b#Many of the lads had their eye on her. Not me, of course, even then, the only one for me was my Evelyn.$1#$b#Not sure what happened. Figure she must've left when the old man died. Folks were always coming and going.",
    "LilyAnneDiscuss_Evelyn": "Lily-Anne? I always felt sorry for her. She seemed lost and out of place here. She hardly spoke to anyone.$2#$b#If I remember, she was pretty close to one of the muckers: a tall, broad fellow with pale hair. There was something odd about him; he was foreign.$1#$b#Anyhow, after Mr. Cheridan died, we all just assumed she returned to the city. Was no life for a lass like her here.",
    "LilyAnneDiscuss_Eyvinder1": "Lily-Anne? I tried to keep an eye on her... but it was hard, me being in the mines most days, and her old grandfather being what he was.$a#$b#No-one saw her leave, but there were other ways out than that bridge. I hope she took one of them.$2",
    "LilyAnneDiscuss_Eyvinder2": "Lily-Anne? Yes, I knew her. We were friends: nothing more, nothing less.$2#$b#I'll tell you about her sometime, but know everything ain't as it seems.",
    "LilyAnneDiscuss_Jasper": "I'm afraid I cannot tell you anything about Miss Lily-Anne, but when the mines were opened, there was considerably evidence that smugglers had made use of the natural caves in the area.#$b#It is not impossible that her ancestors were involved in such activities; and entirely possible to leave the valley without setting foot above ground.",
    "LilyAnneDiscuss_Beatrice": "I know naught about this Lily-Anne, mon cher!$1^I know naught about this Lily-Anne, ma chérie!#$b#But my Raoul, he always said that this coastline was a smugglers' haven, with its many coves an' natural caves.#$b#He always was fond of tales: of pirates and smugglers and ne'er-do-wells. Oh, I do miss him, rest his soul.$2",
    "LilyAnneDiscuss_Jacob": "Doing a bit of research on the history around here? I grew up in Chestervale, but I can write to my mother, if you like?$3#$b#She used to live around here; she'll probably know more.",
