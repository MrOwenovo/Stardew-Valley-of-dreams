                "summer_Wed6": "Dr. Jacob had to euthanise an injured bull yesterday. He was pretty upset about it.#$b#I was a bit too. I guess we city kids don't really think about where meat comes from.",

		"winter_Wed10":"It was a pretty quiet day on the rounds yesterday. Jacob and I spent a lot of time talking.#$b#He's a pretty cool guy. Got some real interesting stories from Gotoro and stuff.",
		"fall_Wed10":"$1 Oliver_Duke#I met the funniest dog yesterday! His name's Duke. His owner's a total eccentric; she dresses him in suits and little hats.$k#$e#Hah, you should've seen what Dukey was wearing yesterday. Here, I have a picture.#$b#I think he's my absolutely favourite patient. And his human, Ms. Winslow always gives us cookies and cake, so she's pretty awesome too."
