/*“I don't believe we have been introduced. I am…”
Or “Do I have the pleasure of addressing..?”
Then “Pleased to make your acquaintance ….”
Perhaps “How lovely to see you again” or “Good day” rather than “Hello”

Dating:
Rather than calling it a date she might say “I should be delighted to accompany you to …” or “You may call on me at such and such time”
The suitor might say “May I call on you, Miss…?” And after a date “May I call on you again?”
