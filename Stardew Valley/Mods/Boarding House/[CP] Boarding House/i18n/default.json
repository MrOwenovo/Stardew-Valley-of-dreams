"event-17170000.01": "Are you real?!$6",
"event-17170000.02": "Sorry for being weird, it's been such a long time since I've seen a human face. The name's Gregory.$1#$b#I have some goods stored if you want to purchase anything, just come to my tent!$7#$b#I cleared the mines yesterday so you haven't ran into any monster, but BEWARE, they might respawn. If you want to avoid them or get here faster you can always use the mine carts.#$b#Don't worry, they're not broken or anything.$1",
"event-17170000.03": "By the way, don't remove the amulet that is in the shrine. If you do so, you won't be able to leave these mines.$7",
"event-17170000.04": "Feel free to collect anything you want from the valley.$1",
//Gregory 2 Hearts
"event-17170001.01": "Hey, you're back.$1#$b#I was practicing some moves. Being here on my own doesn't mean I need to get out of shape.$1#$b#Since you have been nice to me, I'm gonna tell you a secret I learned from when I was an archaeologist.$0#$b#Sometimes you'll find some broken artifacts. If you can find all their missing pieces, you can use slime to glue all the pieces together.$1#$b#Me and Laura, my late wife...We used to do that all the time when retrieving artifacts for museums.$s#",
"event-17170001.02": "Anyway, I know there are a lot of artifact pieces in the mines, so if you can get some slime you can fix'em and sell'em.$1",
"event-17170001.03": "Learned how to restore artifacts from artifact fragments.",
//Gregory 4 Hearts
"event-17170002.01": "Another page of Gregory's Journal It says: Laura, I finally found what I was looking for, the lost valley. Here I encountered a lot of fossil fish and rare ancient fruits. I know that you are no longer here, but writing to you is what keeps me sane. With Luv, Gregory.",
"event-17170002.02": "Oh! Did you read that?",
"event-17170002.03": "Yes, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...",
"event-17170002.04": "(Lie)No, I didn't.",
"event-17170002.05": "Well, this is embarassing. I should have kept these pages with me.$s",
"event-17170002.06": "You see, 8 years ago, Laura and I were exploring some caves in the tundra beyond the frozen sea, and we found the blessed amulet I placed in the shrine.$7#$b#There were some ancient inscriptions saying that this shrine was built for Yoba, and the amulet was a gift from Yoba to the ancient civilization that lived here long ago.$7#$b#This civilization used to live in harmony with the beasts from the valley and the mines.$7",
"event-17170002.07": "One day, a raider found the location of the shrine and stole the amulet. The inscriptions said the monster went rampant and destroyed the village that was located in here.$7#$b#The raider fled to the tundra, but some of the remaning people that lived here followed him to try and retrieve the amulet, so they could return to their home.$7#$b#It seems they all died in the cave. Last traces of the civilization that lived here were found there.$s#$b#Laura's dream was to find this place and research the ancient civilization that lived here.$7#$b#She never made it out of the cave, though.$s#$b#So I decided to find the valley myself. I fought for days in the mines. Killed over 1500 monsters until I finally got here.$s#$b#Since I spent all these days fighting and hiding all by myself, I started writing a journal, so if my journey was futile, at least future generations would've known of my deeds.$s",
"event-17170002.08": "I know it sounds silly, but I felt heartened when I wrote those letters to Laura. I felt I wasn't all alone.$s",
"event-17170002.09": "Sorry, sometimes I get emotional.$s",
"event-17170002.10": "I need some time alone.$s",

"event-17170003.02": "Oh! Cool, so you're a farmer that moved from the city to take over your grandpa's farm?$6#$b#That's really cool, I'm a little bit of a farmer myself--been harvesting ancient fruit and mushrooms.$1#$b#I'm sure it's nothing compared to you. I'm from Castle Village. After high school graduation, I took an Archaeology course and joined the Adventurer's Guild.#$b#I met Laura in college, we used to be classmates.$s",
"event-17170003.03": "Sorry, here I go again speaking of her.",
"event-17170003.04": "It's ok, it must not be easy for you.",
"event-17170003.05": "Just move on, dude!",
"event-17170003.06": "I believe that is what she would want me to do.$1",
"event-17170003.07": "I've been using this place as a way to hide from the fact I failed the person I was supposed to protect.$s#$b#That day, we were surrounded by Iridium Bats. I tried fighting them all, but I was hit in the eye. I was nearly blinded.$7#$b#I tried to protect her, but there were too many, I fought until I passed out because of blood loss.$s#$b#I woke two days later. The Tundra Dwellers had saved me, but Laura wasn't so lucky. She couldn't make it.$s#$b#Once I found this place I made camp and stayed, to live up to her memory.$7#$b#But I guess I should go back to the surface and restart my life.",
"event-17170003.08": "What do you think?",
"event-17170003.09": "That sounds like a good plan.",

I've been haunted by the ghosts of my failure.$s#$b#But you visited me, in my sleep, and I saw clearly.$s#$b#You couldn't let me die for the sake of your dream. So in the end, you protected me.
