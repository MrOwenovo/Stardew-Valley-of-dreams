See you at the saloon!^-Gus",

I gotta say, one taste of your own butter from this churn and you'll never buy it from a store again.^You'll notice it comes out a nice rich yellow color, nothing like the pale stuff from Joja Mart. I'm sure you'll see the difference. And taste it too!^-Marnie",

"still.text": "Dear @,^I've had this old still for years but I never got around to using it quite as much as I intended, mainly because I never set aside the proper ingredients for it.^Then I got a nifty idea. You've got all sorts of ingredients on your farm, so why not experiment a little and see what kinds of spirits you can make? I'll be eager to see how they turn out!^-Gus",
