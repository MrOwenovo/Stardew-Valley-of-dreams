    "69660004.3": "One thing to remember, Miss Penny, is that there is more to a recipe than just the ingredients.#$b#Most of the art of cooking is in the technique.#$b#And that, I'm afraid, takes years of practice.", //Gus

    "69660006.1": "... whilst I will agree that song lyrics can be quite profound, I must respectably disagree that a song explicitly about ... *coughs*#$b#... intimate relationships does not constitute poetry.$5", //Elliott
    "69660006.2": "Really? Because I read your recommended readings... and some of them were outright scandalous!$3", //Haley
    "69660006.3": "The difference, perhaps, is in the subtlety. The metaphor and turn of phrase. This? This is just crass!$8", //Elliott
    "69660006.4": "Hmm, I never took you for a literary snob, Elliott. Or a prude.$3", //Haley
    "69660006.5": "Anyway, @'s here. Hey, @, what do you think?#$b#Should popular music count as poetry?", //Haley

    "69660006.11": "Can you two just agree to disagree on this one?#$b#Now, are we going to hear the poem for today, or not?", //Leah
    "69660006.12": "I am prepared to agree on a compromise, Haley.", //Elliott
    "69660006.13": "For poetry should, at its base level, evoke emotion, and if your popular music affects you at that level, then so be it.$1", //Elliott
    "69660006.14": "Err, thanks. I think.", //Haley
    "69660006.15": "Now if you would care to begin the reading for today...", //Elliott
