				"Tue2":"I was wondering for a while whether someone would move into that farm. It's nice that you did!",
				"Tue4":"The thing I like best about Pelican Town is the amount of independence you can have.#$b#We're all built for cooperation, but in the city, cooperation is more like a blind dependence.#$e#So many people can't last a week without someone else cooking their food or setting their schedule for them.#$b#I think a lot of people who say they want independence don't necessarily follow through.#$e#Sorry, am I being really judgmental right now?$h",
				"Tue6":"I made a little painting for Elliott to hang in his house. Poor guy doesn't have very much to make his home feel cozy.#$e#I respect how much he sacrifices to pursue what he wants, though. We're both out here for similar reasons.",

				"summer_Tue4":"I walked by Marnie's ranch yesterday, and the cows just kept looking at me.#$e#Their faces were so gentle.#$e#Do you have some cows, too?",

				"summer_Fri4":"Nature itself will always be a greater artist than any one of us.#$e#You work directly with nature, though. Yeah, I'd say farming is an art, of sorts.",
				"summer_Fri8":"It's been really quiet in my cabin lately.$s#$b#I'm happy if you drop by.#$e#So, how's your day going?",
				"summer_Sat4":"I keep up a pretty strict pescatarian diet. It's not that I'm morally opposed to eating meat, but...#$b#...as long as everyone has their own way of showing respect for nature, I'm fine with 'em. This is just my way, for me.",
				"summer_Sat6":"Yeah, I go to the beach a lot during the summer.#$b#Of course, you can join me. Don't be shy.$h",
				"summer_Sat8":"Let me know if you find anything tasty in the woods, okay?#$e#Sometimes it's tough living the poverty lifestyle, but I wouldn't want to eat any differently even if I had money.",
				"summer_Sat10":"Hey you.$l#$e#You're just the one who was missing from my day.#$e#I need a hug. C'mere.",

				"fall_Tue":"So, what do you enjoy most about living on a farm?",
				"fall_Tue2":"I wonder if I could make a collage out of dried leaves?#$e#They're just so colorful... I can't help but think of the potential for art projects.$h",
				"fall_Tue8":"I've been feeling pretty inspired lately. Fall brings out a more personal side to me.",
				"fall_Tue10":"I usually try to keep myself out of my art, and let it just exist for the sake of its own beauty, rather than myself.#$e#Sometimes, though, I can't help it. That sculpture I gave you would be one example.$l",
				"fall_Wed2":"It's so nice living by the river.#$e#Sometimes, I can hear the salmon leaping and splashing out of the water.",
				"fall_Wed4":"It's so nice to live by the river.#$e#I fall asleep to the soothing sound of water every night.",

				"fall_Thu2":"Do you ever take a whole day off?#$e#It's a refreshing break.",
				"fall_Thu4":"I bet you could grow wild produce on your farm. Have you tried that?#$e#Nothing beats the sense of reward that comes from finding something delicious in the forest, but it might be convenient if you don't have time to forage.",
				"fall_Thu8":"I don't have much connection with my parents anymore. We just kind of grew apart.#$e#I call them every once in a while, but we've mainly got our own lives these days.#$e#Why, is that unusual to you?",
				"fall_Fri2":"Hello. How's your day going?",
				"fall_Fri4":"Have you ever tried the wine from the valley?#$e#Better yet, you could probably make your own wine on your farm. That would be amazing.$h",
				"fall_Fri10":"I was just looking at my fall decorations. I wonder if I'll have kids of my own someday who I can share that with?",
				"fall_Sat":"If you hear any banging from inside my hut, it's probably just me working on one of my sculptures.",
				"fall_Sat2":"Decorations accentuate the feeling of the season. I think it's a worthwhile tradition.",
				"fall_Sat4":"Heyyy! So what do you think of my fall decorations?$h#$e#You should have some Spirit's Eve decorations for your farm. Nothing too creepy, though.",
				"fall_Sat6":"It's nice just to make something fun and whimsical every now and then, like the decorations on my house.#$e#Gotta get in touch with that inner child, right?$h",
				"fall_Sat10":"Hey. You should come by my place tomorrow morning. Bring a couple of omelets and we'll call it brunch.$h#$e#Sorry, if you're looking to get creative, there aren't a whole lot of other breakfast-y things I like.",

				"winter_Mon4":"I keep up a pretty strict pescatarian diet. It's not that I'm morally opposed to eating meat, but...#$b#...as long as everyone has their own way of showing respect for nature, I'm fine with 'em. This is just my way, for me.",
				"winter_Mon6":"I love the way everything looks when it's covered with fresh snow.",
				"winter_Mon8":"One of my earlier memories is from a time I went sledding. I sped down the slope and crashed into a pile of snow.#$e#I remember lying there, hearing to the silence and watching the sky, with the snow falling down on my face. I just wanted to stay there forever.",
				"winter_Tue":"Don't you think the saloon has just the right atmosphere for winter time? It's so cozy.",
				"winter_Tue4":"It gets pretty cold in my little cabin.$s#$e#I just snuggle up under a huge blanket, and I'm okay.$h",

				"winter_Wed6":"I never felt truly safe in the city. Here, though, I don't even have to worry about locking my door.",
				"winter_Wed8":"Seen any snow rabbits out there? I think they're one of my favorite things in the woods this time of year.",
				"winter_Thu":"I love to decorate for the different seasons.",
				"winter_Thu2":"I'm having a hard time finding fresh food to eat.#$e#I've been eating a lot of bread.$s",
				"winter_Thu4":"I hope Elliott's doing okay in his little house. I like to think I have it hard sometimes, but that guy really knows how to rough it out.",
				"winter_Thu10":"Snow on the ground outside, someone who loves me in my arms... Yeah, this is pretty nice.$l",
				"winter_Fri2":"So, what do you enjoy most about living on a farm?#$e#You must have a lot more time on your hands lately.",

				"winter_Sat8":"Do you ever get cold in that farmhouse of yours?#$e#Stop by my cabin if you want to huddle under one of my quilts and drink cider.$h",
				"winter_Sun2":"I hate to be blunt, but if we don't treat nature with respect, our grandchildren will be doomed.#$e#Don't you think so?",
				"winter_Sun4":"Apparently, there was an old woman who lived in my hut before I did.#$e#After she died, Mayor Lewis held the property until I was able to come through and sign for it.",
