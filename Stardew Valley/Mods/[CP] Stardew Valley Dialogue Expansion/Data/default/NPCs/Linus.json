				"Mon2":"I found some trash on the ground here. I hope it wasn't you, was it?",
				"Mon4":"When berry season arrives, there's more than enough food to go around.#$e#You just have to know how to look for them, and they come in abundance.",
				"Mon6":"There's nothing like the feeling of making it through another winter with just the gifts of the mountain.$h",
				"Mon8":"Me? Married? Haha, no, I've never been married.$h#$e#I've never demanded that anyone else should conform to my lifestyle.",
				"Tue2":"Is there something that you want?",
				"Tue6":"A long time ago, yes, I grew up in a family. I haven't seen them for many years.#$e#I don't think I can even remember their faces anymore...$s",
				"Tue10":"Well, @, I suppose I could consider you a part of my new family, if that's alright.$h#$e#Oh, please don't be alarmed. The trees, the rocks, the lake, the sky... they are all my family, too.",
				"Wed4":"This land will continue to exist for many eons past our lifetimes.#$b#Please do treat it with respect.",
				"Thu":"...Hmm? Do you want something from me?",
				"Thu2":"...Maybe I need to pack up my tent and move again.$s",
				"Thu6":"Yes, you saw me taking food from the trash cans that one time...$s#$e#Usually, I just live on the food that nature provides, but the food that others throw out goes to complete waste if I don't take it.$s#$e#Is that any way to treat the world that provides for us?",
				"Thu8":"Sometimes, people don't understand me, but that doesn't make them bad.#$e#It just bothers me when they show hostility.",
				"Thu10":"There is a beauty in caring for others.#$b#So if I find something delicious and there's enough for two, I'll leave it in your mailbox.$h",
				"Fri":"Please don't destroy my tent.#$e#It's happened before.$s",
				"Fri2":"Why do you keep visiting me?",
				"Fri8":"Where do we go after we die? I suppose I'll go into the ground.#$e#Just back into the flow of nature, is all.#$e#It doesn't have to be so bad, if you think about it.#$e#I guess I'm not quite ready for that yet, though.$h",
				"Sat":"I'm happy by myself, you know.#$e#I don't need new friends.",
				"Sat2":"...Hello, again.",
				"Sat6":"I don't imagine I'll stay here much longer.#$e#Don't be alarmed if you come up here and my tent is suddenly gone.#$e#That's how I've always done it.",
				"Sat8":"Perhaps I'll stay here another year.#$e#I don't normally stay put in one place for this long, but...$s",
				"Sat10":"At this rate, I may just stay here indefinitely.$h#$e#I can live in nature as much as I want, but I'm not too far away from at least one good neighbor. Thank you, @.",
				"Sun2":"You don't have to speak to me if you don't want to.",
				"Sun8":"When I first met you, @, I was sure I would be leaving the valley soon. Thank you for helping to change my mind.",
				"summer_Mon10":"Where did all the trash in the water come from? I don't understand...$s",
				"summer_Tue8":"Marlon and Gil? Yes, I see them every now and then.#$e#We mostly keep to ourselves.",
				"summer_Wed10":"The world existed long before we ever did. And it will continue to exist long after we leave it.#$e#Thinking deeply about this truth has guided the way I live.",
				"summer_Thu10":"I respect what you do on your farm, @. As long as you take care of the ecosystem your farm is a part of, we have nothing to fear.",
				"summer_Sat10":"What is it that mankind ultimately lives for? Comfort? No, it cannot be something so base as that.#$e#I have no single answer for why we are here. Kindness? Harmony? Love? These are the things I desire most.",
				"summer_Sun6":"I once caught a bass in the lake that was longer than my arm.$h#$e#That was a long time ago. I don't know that I'll ever break that record.",
				"fall_Mon8":"I'll admit, I've followed you into the mines before, from a distance.#$e#I'm sorry. I just want to make sure you stay safe...",
				"fall_Tue10":"Hi there, @!$h#$e#Find any good foraging spots today?",
				"fall_Wed8":"The mountain owes us nothing, yet it still gives. Anything we take is an undeserved gift. We must never forget to be thankful.",
				"fall_Fri10":"I've never lived only for myself. I just wish to be in harmony with all parts of nature... the plants and trees, the animals, even the rocks.#$e#Lately, I might have a tiny bias in favor of people over the rest of nature. Perhaps that's only natural.$h",
				"fall_Sat10":"Everyone must discover and understand the role they can best play in the world.#$e#For example, there's just as much nature underground as there is up here.#$b#But if I stay in the mines too long, my lungs get heavy and my eyes long for sunshine. It goes against my nature.#$e#The same could be said for all aspects of life, inside and out.#$b#Have you found your role yet, @?$h",
				"fall_Sun10":"Have you tried fishing with wild bait yet?",
				"winter_Mon6":"I could hide indefinitely from the cold in the hot spring, but that isn't where I live.#$e#I'd rather not step on anyone's toes. The building belongs to the village.",
				"winter_Tue8":"If I play things right, I can go for a week or so without food.#$e#It isn't my first choice, but I can do it if it becomes necessary.",
				"winter_Wed8":"Rasmodius is a good friend. We only run into each other every now and then, but we always pick up where we left off.",
				"winter_Thu8":"The family in that house seemed annoyed by my presence when I first settled here. Lately, though, they seem fine with me.",
				"winter_Fri10":"Is suffering a natural part of a harmonious life? I'm inclined to say yes, though it depends upon the kind of suffering.#$e#Do not be afraid of any discomfort or hardship that is ultimately feasible, @. We are always stronger than we think.",
				"winter_Sat10":"Each day we live is a gift to be cherished with deep gratitude. We already have more than we deserve.",
				"winter_Sun8":"It's important to know that we don't really matter. The world will carry on whether we humans exist or not.",
				"spring_1_2":"Breathe in that spring air!$h#$b#The valley is coming to life.$h",
				"summer_10":"I think I might take a risk tomorrow at the luau and share a little of my cooking.",
				"winter_15":"I caught a glimpse of the ships docking at the beach, from my view up on the mountain.#$e#Maybe I'll give them a look up close.",
				"winter_28":"We made it.$h#$e#*chuckle*$h",
				"summer_10_2":"I think I might take a risk tomorrow at the luau and share a little of my cooking.",
				"winter_15_2":"I caught a glimpse of the ships docking at the beach, from my view up on the mountain.#$e#Maybe I'll give them a look up close.",
				"winter_28_2":"We made it.$h#$e#*chuckle*$h"
