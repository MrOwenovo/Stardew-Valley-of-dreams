			"Tue":"On Wednesdays the shop is closed.#$e#Keep that in mind if you're going to need anything.",
			"Tue2":"If you need fast cash, Pierre will be happy to buy whatever produce you have.#$e#Even if it's foraged, we'll still take it. Those kinds of items give our stock a bit of local character.$h",
			"Tue4":"Jodi and I have been friends for a number of years now. I'm so glad that she and her family moved into town.#$e#Sometimes I wonder if I could even get by without her.",
			"Tue6":"I'm still amazed with how Jodi went back for round two, raising another boy. I remember Sam was quite a handful.$h#$e#It was \"one and done\" for Pierre and me. That was our plan from the get-go.",
			"Tue8":"Pierre's a hard worker. Sometimes I feel guilty about how much he's sacrificed to keep this store running.",
			"Tue10":"Jodi and I were just talking about some of the things you've done for the community.$h#$e#Personally, I'm glad that you're a positive influence on Abby.$h",

			"Thu4":"#$1 Caroline1#Hmmm... I wonder if I can get Pierre to cook dinner tonight.#$e#Hmmm... what am I going to make for dinner tonight?#$e#Maybe I'll just get take-out from the Saloon.",
			"Thu6":"$d Joja#I'm worried about Pierre. Each time we lose business to JojaMart, he can barely sleep for days.|I'm never going to forget the day Pierre stood up to Morris like that. It reminds me of when we were both younger.$h",
			"Fri4":"Abby goes to the saloon with a couple of her friends on Friday nights. Maybe you could join them?",

			"Fri8":"$d Joja#Jodi's my best friend, but does she have to shop at JojaMart? I don't know how to address the topic appropriately with her.$s|One of the best things about JojaMart closing down is that I don't have to worry about Jodi shopping there anymore.$h",

			"Sat4":"It's funny, I can't remember whether the aerobics club was my idea or someone else's.#$b#I think it just happened organically. Exercise has always been my thing, and our living room seemed perfect for it, so...",
			"Sat6":"I thought I'd set a good example for Abigail with the aerobics classes I host, but if anything, it just seems like it pushed her away from wanting to exercise.#$e#I guess I shouldn't be surprised.",
			"Sat8":"#$1 Caroline12#When we first moved here, I took a while to settle down... I wasn't ready for the domestic life.#$e#Pierre's a bit traditional... but he's a good man. He's ambitious, but he always puts his family first.",
			"Sun2":"Feel free to pray at the Shrine of Yoba if you'd like.#$e#No, it's not really my thing. I do respect those who practice, though.",

			"fall_Thu":"Are you doing any foraging this season? I've seen edible mushrooms in the forest.#$e#I should probably mention that I'm not a big fan of them, though.",
			"fall_Thu6":"There are some good recipes that you can make year round with wild mushrooms, so it's not a bad idea to stock up.#$e#Or if you're not much of a cook, you can always sell them to us.",
			"fall_Thu8":"$d Joja#I'm worried about Pierre. Each time we lose business to JojaMart, he can barely sleep for days.|I'm never going to forget the day Pierre stood up to Morris like that. It reminds me of when we were both younger.$h",
