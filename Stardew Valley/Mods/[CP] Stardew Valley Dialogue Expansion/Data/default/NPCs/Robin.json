				"Mon":"Hey there, @.#$e#I was just daydreaming about some new carpentry projects.#$e#Are you doing OK at your place? How's the woodwork in your cottage holding up?",
				"Mon2":"Have I told you that I built our house from the ground up?#$e#It's definitely been the highlight of my career so far.",
				"Mon4":"Nahh, I don't go into the mines all that much. Too dark and dangerous.#$e#Let me know if you find anything neat down there, though.",
				"Mon6":"Demetrius's work technically brought us out here. I'd say it's worked out pretty well, though.",
				"Tue2":"There used to be some great buildings on your farm, but they're all gone now.#$e#I'd love to help restore the farm anew. Just let me know what I can do.",
				"Tue4":"Leah's got a good handle on woodworking, too. I just prefer to make things with a little more practical use.",
				"Tue6":"Demetrius may be a bit stoic, with his scientific brain, but I learned pretty quickly how to get through to his romantic side.#$e#I did teach him how to dance with me, after all.$h",
				"Tue8":"I must say, you've certainly been quite a support for our business since you moved into town.$h",

				"Thu2":"Have you tried reaching out to Sebastian yet?",

				"Sat4":"Ugh, I wish Sebastian wouldn't smoke.$s#$e#I don't even know where he picked that up from.$s",

				"fall_Mon4":"Has Maru showed you any of her latest projects yet?",
				"fall_Mon8":"It was about when Maru became a teenager that I knew she was something else with machines.#$e#As a kid, she would always take apart our electronics, though she couldn't always put them back together.#$e#But eventually, she reached a point where she'd put them back together in her own way, with modifications.#$b#I'm really proud of how advanced she's become.",

				"winter_Wed":"I think I need a little me-time. A visit to the hot spring might be in order.#$e#Do you ever go?",
				"winter_Wed6":"Architecture styles and home fashions might come and go, but they all have one goal in mind: to make a better place to live.#$e#Humanity has always sought a better place to live. It's as old as history itself. So I enjoy the feel of that connection in my work.",
