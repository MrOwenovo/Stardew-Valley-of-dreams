				"Mon2":"Ahoy there, son.^Ahoy there, lass.#$b#Looks like decent weather for fishing, eh?",
				"Mon6":"If you sell me some fish, I'll be sure to tell whoever buys it that you're the one who caught it.$h",
				"Mon8":"I'll post some more fishing challenges on Pierre's bulletin board if the mood fancies me. I hope you'll keep an eye out for 'em.",
				"Tue2":"There are two worlds: the one we live in, and the much, much older one beneath the water.#$e#I think of what I do as a dialogue between those two worlds.",
				"Tue4":"To take the life of a fish, you have to respect it first. You certainly won't last long in this profession, otherwise.",
				"Tue8":"I'm happy that I entrusted you with my old rod, @, back when we first met. You've been a good friend.$h",
				"Wed2":"The waves are pretty calm at our beach. That's the only way I can manage to have my shop out on the dock itself.",
				"Wed4":"Have I ever been lost at sea? No. Never.#$b#I always take the appropriate precautions. If you know what you're doing, you never compromise your safety.",
				"Wed6":"Remember, anywhere there's water, there's likely to be fish.#$b#You get out a little more than I do, so I hope you find some exotic varieties.$h#$e#Just don't bring it to me if it's a bit TOO exotic, though.$s",
				"Wed8":"I've never been married, no.#$e#I loved someone once, long ago. She left me for another man.#$e#Sometimes, the one that gets away, stays away forever.$s",
				"Thu2":"It never ceases to amaze me how much trash winds up in the water.$s#$e#It's up to us to take care of it. Preferably, it should be recycled.",

				"Thu6":"There's rumors of some very rare fish in these parts... but only an experienced angler could stand a chance against them.#$e#You'll need the finest bait you can get if you want a rare fish to bite.",
				"Thu8":"My biggest catch ever was from when I was young, like you.#$b#Who knows, though? It's still possible that I could outdo myself.$h",
				"Fri":"How's your rod holding up?",
				"Fri2":"If you really want to get the fish biting, make sure you put some bait on your hook.",
				"Fri4":"If you ever catch a lobster in a crab pot, be sure to share some with Elliott. It's his favorite.",
				"Fri6":"Made any good chowder yet?$h#$e#It's an old classic.$h",
				"Fri8":"We can all agree that fishing'll teach you patience. I can't think of a better skill to practice.#$b#Life itself is a waiting game. And then it ends. I pity anyone who never learns how to wait properly.",
				"Sat2":"I've learned some good fish recipes over the years. Maybe I'll share some with you sometime.",
				"Sat4":"If you see me out fishing, you just come on up beside me and cast your line, too.#$b#You're always welcome to.$h",
				"Sat6":"When you're waiting for a bite, listening to a bit of music on the radio is a great way to pass the time.#$b#Our ancestors had no such luxuries, though. So sometimes I cut the music and listen to the sounds of nature, out of admiration for the old ways.",

				"spring_Fri8":"If you catch a really common fish, it's actually more profitable to clean it and cut it yourself.#$e#That's if you're sellin' elsewhere. Me, I only buy whole fish.",
				"summer_Mon10":"The islands south of us sure are some beauties, with Ginger Island bein' the best one, I think.",
				"summer_Tue10":"If ya listen closely to the fish, they'll tell ya what they want.#$e#Some o' them are li'l prima donnas, heh! I'm thinking those sturgeons have some delusions of grandeur.$h",
				"summer_Wed2":"That carpenter Robin'll build you a fish pond, mmm? That could work. Just make sure you treat those fish extra well.#$e#Some of 'em just need the wild ocean, or the streams, y'know? Not all fish live in ponds for a reason.",
				"summer_Wed10":"Lately, I've been wonderin' if I've taken too much from the ocean. What could I give back to it? I owe it my entire livelihood.$s",
