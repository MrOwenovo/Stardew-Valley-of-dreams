Make sure to have the latest versions of the required mods:
	- SMAPI
	- Content Patcher
	- Content Patcher Animations
	- and Lunna - Astray (and the mods required for Lunna - Astray)

If the animation is flickering it may be caused by another mod editing the same items.
You can disable specific animations in the config.json file to fix this, or remove this or the other mod.
