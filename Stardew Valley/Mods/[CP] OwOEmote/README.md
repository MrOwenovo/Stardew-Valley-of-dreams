Vewy fancy!! Replaces the :3 emote with an OwO emote~

Replaces player emotes, villager expressions, and so on!

## Installation

1. Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Install [Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) into your Stardew Valley Mods folder.
    - On Windows, your Mods folder is usually located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Stardew Valley\Mods`.
3. Grab the latest release on GitHub or Nexus, then add the whole unzipped folder into your Mods folder.
4. Smile and enjoy~ owo

If you want your friends to see this emote, tell them to install this mod too! In multiplayer, other players won't be able to see this emote if they don't have this mod installed. Instead, it'll just show up as the default :3 emote for them otherwise.

(This is a mod for the game Stardew Valley.)

## Config

*If you prefer,* there is a variant just for aesthetics that lowers the height of the eyes on the emote, providing a calmer look.

You can change this setting in-game by installing the [Generic Mod Config](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) mod! (It also can be useful for configuring other mods like this one.)

Or, you can also go into the config.json file located in this mod's files and set `Smaller Eyes` to `true`!
