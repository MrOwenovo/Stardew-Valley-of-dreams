VERSION 1.3.4 // Released June 17, 2022

- added ability to toggle gendered dialogue if you'd like (uses he/she and the gender of farmer rather than 'they') Please note due to the large amount of dialogues edited I was unable to catch all dialogue errors, so please inform me if you encounter any strange dialogue!
- fixed some typos
- to translators: this update adds many copies of the existing files - since i don't know how pronouns + etc are handled in other languages, i apologize for any work overload and it's completely fine to just ignore this update for your translation!

ADDITIONS:

FIXES:
- altered certain dialogues that referred to the player to be more gender-neutral due to a request to do so
- added specific compatibility with Ridgeside Village 2.1 (new marriage candidates sean + kiarra will now have unique foods and unique music during specific dates, and fixed broken music themes during dance date due to rsv changing its unique id for music)
- added unique foods + music for Adventurer's Guild Expanded spouses Gabriel and Zinnia - it's my new mod! check it out if you haven't already ;)
