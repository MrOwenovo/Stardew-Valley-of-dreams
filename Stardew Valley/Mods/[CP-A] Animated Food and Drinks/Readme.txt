Make sure to have the latest versions of the required mods:
	- SMAPI
	- Content Patcher
	- and Content Patcher Animations

If the animation is flickering it may be caused by another animation mod editing the same items.
You can disable specific animations in the config.json file to fix this, or remove this or the other mod.
